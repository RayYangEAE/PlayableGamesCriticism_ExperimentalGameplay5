RPG Minesweeper

1. Inspiration

	mine sweeper & tile-based dungeon game
 

2. My Goal

	Minesweeper is one of our first computer games. It is easy to understand and fun to play. But the story is not as compelling.
	So Iâ€™d like to integrate some RPG/roguelike elements into the gameplay.

	a. Minesweeper buttons are perfect for changing it to tile-based game;
	
	b. Numbers indicating mines are good to show alerts for dangers unseen;
	
	c. It is perfect to add on some dark dungeon theme there!
 

3. Gameplay

	a. The map is covered by mist, and you need to find the exit out;
	
	b. Clear the mist by click on the tile adjacent to the cleared and passable tile;
	
	c. Dent is not passable;
	
	d. Encountering a monster will take you 50 hp damage; (you have 100 total)
	
	e. The number shown on the ground tile means how many monsters around this tile in the mist;
	
	f. Find the exit before your hp drops to 0 to win the game!
 

4. What I have learned? (my failed experiments)

	a. My first try: sphere map for Civilization; (why don't Civ 5&6 use sphere map)
	
		- The map cannot be made up of all hexagon tiles (Icosahedron - 12 pentagons & every hexagon can't guarantee the same shape)
		
		- Unfair for players born on poles (poles are covered by ice)
		
		- The view is annoying, messing with directions
		
		- But the sphere map still looks fantasy, 12 pentagons can be tolerant in a big map, but for balancing problem, players have to be born near the equator -- the sphere map still has a chance to be a game mode

	b. My second try: Civilization policy cards;
	
		- Bring in evaluation & investment concept in game, this design is good
		
		- It is fun when interacting with other systems, amazing amplification effect
		
		- Micro controls are annoying and disturbing, too frequent
		
		- It is worthy to have a try on re-designing the policy cards and the frequency, but this system need to work together with other systems which I cannot prototype in a week
